The gedit Python outline plugin provides a Python code outline side pane.

https://live.gnome.org/Gedit/PythonOutlinePlugin (the old gedit2 version 
of the plugin)

To install, copy these files to the ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/ directory, 
and restart gedit. Now when you go to the Preferences dialog and click on 
the Plugins tab, you'll see "Python Outline" ready to be enabled.

After enabling, the plugin will create an outline pane in your left panel 
whenever you have a python file open in the active tab.

NOTE: this plugin requires the logilab-astng python library. In Ubuntu, this
is in the default repositories, and the package is called python-logilab-astng.
